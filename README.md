Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed this assignment:
```
> ***One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.*** 
>
> ***The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.*** 
>
> ***There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.*** 
> 
> ***Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.*** 
>
> ***When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.*** 
>
> ***Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.*** 
> 
> ***Philosophers don’t speak with each other.***
> 
> ***Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.***
> 
> ***No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!***
