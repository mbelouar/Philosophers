# Introduction:
` Summary: `
```
In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process.
You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes
```
```
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. 
Your goal? Write aprogram in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments. Easy? 
We’ll see...
```
` Objectives: `
```
Writing a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a developer’s journey. It is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity.
Sorting algorithms and their complexity are part of the classic questions discussed during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts since you’ll have to face them at some point.
The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C,and use of basic algorithms. Especially focusing on their complexity.
Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can differ.
